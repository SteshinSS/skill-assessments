# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Key Features:
- Hot Seat Mode. Play with your friends on one screen!
- Comprehensive AI. Play with a computer if you don't have friends!
- Portability. Play at any device with an R interpreter!
- Say bye to erros! You won't see exceptions anymore.

## Next Steps:
I finished the task, so I will rather work on other assignments, but the game could be improved:
- Add CLI. I refrained from using packages, but it could be useful to track pressed keys and to use packages for a cute user interface.
- Improve AI. At the moment it works on heuristics, but we can code the best AI using the BFS algorithm. Since there are few game states, the algorithm can traverse the game tree pretty quick.
- Make code modular. In a real project, I would separate user interface code from the game logic.
